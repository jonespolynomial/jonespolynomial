I am an applied mathematics student at McGill University looking to move towards pure math and theoretical physics in grad school. 

Previously, I had been interested in psychology, neuroscience, and machine learning; I had performed personality psychology research with Prof. Christopher Steele at Concordia University, 
computational neuroscience research with Prof. Pouya Bashivan at McGill University, and Natural Language Processing research with Prof. Mengye Ren at the NYU Center for Data Science.
